Welcome to Goldmap! This map is designed to visualize geological and geochemical indicators of gold within the United States with a little remote sensing thrown in. 

Things to note:

- For preformance, visibility on points is limited unitl you zoom further in. 

- The composite heatmap is a composite of all the normal maps, weighted to favor the geochemical data first, the geological data second, and the landsat band composite very little(due to its quality).

-Geological heatmap is based on the presence of the folliowing geology:

Greenstone (Greenstone Belts), Granite, Granodiorite, Diorite, Rhyolite, Schist, Amphibolite, Banded Iron Formation (BIF), Pegmatite, Serpentinite, Basalt and Basaltic-andesite, Granulite, Kimberlite


-Geochemical heatmap is based on the following elements and minerals, with elements recieving greater weight. 
Arsenic (As)
Antimony (Sb)
Bismuth (Bi)
Silver (Ag)
Copper (Cu)
Lead (Pb)
Zinc (Zn)
Tungsten (W)
Iron (Fe)
Sulfur (S)
Hematite
Goethite
Pyrite
Serpentine
Quartz
- Landsat layer is a band ratio calculation based on a somewhat low quality Landsat 8 composite, the band ratios are used to highlight potential zones of alteration.
